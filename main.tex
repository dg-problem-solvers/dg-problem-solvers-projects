\section{Gauss Parametrisation On The Sphere}

The aim here is to obtain a parametrisation of a family of convex bodies in the sphere, analogous to the Gauss-map parametrisation in Euclidean space. 

\begin{itemize}
\item Via projections. 

The idea is to define a projection map $\mathbb{S}^{n+1} \to \mathbb{R}^{n+1}$. This should at the very least take convex bodies to convex bodies. These projections generally are ``based at a point'', $p_0$. Ideally these should also be conformal. Some candidates (not all conformal) are
\begin{itemize}
\item Gnomic Projection,
\item Steriographic Projection,
\item Vertical projection (Orthogonal projection onto the hyperplane orthogonal to $p_0$).
\end{itemize}
Now we have a Gauss-map on $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ using only the differentiable structure on $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ and so our Gauss map is composition of the Euclidean Gauss map with the projection map. Equivalently, we can just work on $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ with the metric induced by the projection and completely forget about the sphere. The best candidate seems to be steriographic projection since it realises there sphere as locally conformally flat (all we miss is a single point!) and the conformal factor is rotationally symmetric.

For this to work, the base point needs to be chosen correctly. For shrinking flows that collapse to a point, this should be the point of collapse, and for expanding flows that converge to an equator, this should be either centre of the equator. One needs to take a little care with the class of solutions that exist for all time and don't collapse, e.g. closed curves bounding an area equal to $2\pi$ will exist for all time and converge to an equator under the curve shortening flow (a shrinking flow), so really should be treated like expanding flows.

\item Support function parametrisations.

Here we need a translation map $\tau$ taking the normal $\nu$ to a fixed ``base point'' $p_0$ and above. Then the support function should measure the distance from the base point to the tangent equator. As a function of $x\in M$ the hypersurface, this should be $s(x) = \nu(x) \cdot d \grad d$ where $d$ is the distance from $p_0$ to $x$. In geodesic polar coordinates, $d \grad d = r \partial_r$. Our translation map has to have some uniqueness properties, in particular, a convex hypersurface should provide a diffeomorphism of the hypersurface onto the unit sphere $U_{p_0} \mathbb{S}^{n+1} \subset T_{p_0} \mathbb{S}^{n+1}$. Then to parametrise the hypersurface we first do
\[
z \in U_{p_0} \mathbb{S}^{n+1} \mapsto y = \exp_{p_0} (s(z) z)
\]
The equator $E_x$ through $y$ perpendicular to the geodesic connecting $p_0$ to $y$ (i.e. $\gamma(t) = \exp_{p_0} (t z)$ with $\gamma(s(z)) = y$) should intersect $M$ in precisely one point $x$, which is the point with $\tau \nu = z$. Letting $\alpha(z) = d(y, x)$ and \(v(z) \in T_y E\) such that \(x = \exp_y(\alpha(z) v(z))\), our parametrisation now becomes
\[
\varphi: z \in U_{p_0} \mathbb{S}^{n+1} \mapsto \exp_{\exp_{p_0} (s(z) z)} (\alpha(z) v) = \exp_{y} (\alpha(z) v(z)).
\]

If this is analogous to the Euclidean space situation, \(\alpha(z) v(z) = \tau_{p_0,y} \grad s (z)\) where \(\tau_{p_0,y}\) denotes parallel translation along the geodesic \(\gamma(t) = \exp_{p_0} (t z)\) from the point \(p_0\) (\(t=0\)) to the point \(y\) (\(\gamma(s(z))\). 
\end{itemize}

All this being resolved, then changing from one of the parametrisations above to the flow parametrisation should take the Harnack inequality $\partial_t F \geq 0$ to the Harnack inequality \(\partial_t F + \|\mathcal{W}\|_{\dot{F}} \geq 0\). Perhaps it takes it to something else and this ``something else'' is in fact the sharp Harnack inequality. All of this seems difficult to compute! It may be easiest to work in the conformally flat model offered by steriographic projection where calculations could be rather more explicit.

\section{Type II Singularity Classification}

The aim here is to classify Type II singularities of Mean Convex MCF (or more general flows, why not?) as Bowl solitons. A possible approach is to obtain a Harnack inequality for the non-collapsing two-point function $k$ and show equality is attained precisely on rotationally symmetric translating solitons, hence the Bowl soliton by uniqueness. In fact, we may only need a Harnack inequality for translating graphs (are all translators graphs over the hyperplane orthogonal to the translation direction?) in which equality is attained precisely on rotationally symmetric translating graphs!

\section{Andrews Gauss Curvature Flow Conjecture}

The aim is to show that the Gauss curvature flow of convex, closed hypersurfaces converges to round points in all dimensions.

\section{Classification of (Quasi) Ancient Solutions on the Sphere}

\begin{itemize}
\item Non-collapsing leads to very short argument for classification with 1-homogeneous speeds.
\item Convex Rigidity + Aleksandrov reflection gives a classification for any imaginable allowable speed, even in the quasi-ancient case.
\item What are the equivalent conditions to \cite{2014arXiv1405.7509H} for convex ancient solutions on the sphere?
\end{itemize}

\section{Harnack and Ancient solutions on Riemannian Manifolds with Positive Curvature}

\begin{itemize}
\item Possibly two projects?
\item If $\ric \geq K_0 g$, for $K_0 \geq 0$, do we obtain a Harnack inequality?
\item Use centre manifold analysis to show ancient solutions exist near minimal hyper-surfaces and to obtain uniqueness. Convex ancient solutions should correspond to totally geodesic hyper-surfaces.
\end{itemize}

\section{(Quasi) Ancient solutions with singular backwards limits}

\begin{itemize}
\item For quasi-ancient solutions of the flow $H^p$, $0<p<1$ in the sphere, if $H$ is bounded then Rigidity + Alexsandrov reflection gives classification.
\item Are there quasi-ancient solutions with $H$ unbounded backwards in time?
\item Given any convex polyhedra, we should be able to use the Harnack inequality (like Hamilton, ref?) to show that there is a unique solution emanating from the polyhedron. The question is, can such solutions be quasi-ancient? If the polyhedron is strictly convex, the answer is no, because we have a barrier starting with a geodesic sphere that is not an equator. But if the polyhedron intersects an equator in at least 2 points, no such initial barrier exists so we cannot immediately rule these out. The example to bear in mind here is that of Lunes. Can we estimate the speed at which the singular backwards limit pulls away from the equator to then insert a barrier at time $-T_S + \epsilon$ for which the flow exists for strictly less time than $-T_S + \epsilon$? This would rule out non-singular limits. On the other hand, could we perhaps show that singular limits do exists by constructing one?
\item Blow up analysis: Set $\lambda_k := \sup\limits_{(x,t)\in M\times [-t_k,-\varepsilon]} H(x,t),$ where $t_k$ approaches $-T_S$ and $\varepsilon>0$ is small enough. Set $\lambda_{\infty}=\lim_{k\to\infty}\lambda_k$ and $x_k(\cdot,t):=(\lambda_k+1)x(\cdot, t_k+(\lambda_k+1)^{-p-1}t)$. Then if $\lambda_{\infty} < \infty$ it should be possible to show $x_{\infty}$ is an equator. If $\lambda_{\infty} = \infty$, then the $x_{\infty}$ is a translating soliton. In the latter case, there is a singular backwards limit! The question is whether such things can exist. Do Lunes, or more generally (non-strictly) convex polyhedra blow up to look like translating solitons?
\end{itemize}
